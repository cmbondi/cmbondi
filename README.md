## Greetings, I'm Colin
### Technologist . Consultant . Peaceful Warrior

#### About
I've been into tech all my life from tech support to networking to development of various kinds. I tend to be a technology generalist with a few areas of focus and my work involves mostly tech consulting for individuals, small/medium business and non-profits. My current interests involve python development, leveraging AI technologies with small business and creating new pathways through which technology can be used to reverse the damage human greed and ignorance have unleashed on the world. I have a strong grounding in spirituality and meditation that informs my work and genuinely wish to make a positive difference in the areas I'm involved in.
