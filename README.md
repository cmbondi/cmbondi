## Greetings, I'm Colin
### Technologist and aspiring coder/web developer

#### About
I've been into technology all my life. Started out in Psychology but moved into IT soon after my degree as that was more my calling. I've done tech support, network engineering and wordpress web design. I'm shifting my career to more serious and indepth web development by working to become a full stack JavaScript engineer. Learning from a variety of resources and posting what I've done here in the hope of securing web development work in the near future. I'm a friendly upbeat sort of person so feel free to reach out and I'd love to connect with other tech people.
