## Greetings, I'm Colin
### Technologist/Web Designer/Web Developer - FSJS TechDegree student @ Treehouse

#### About
I've been into technology all my life. Started out in Psychology but moved into IT soon after my degree as that was more my calling. I've done tech support, network engineering and web design. I'm shifting my career to more serious and indepth web development by working to become a full stack JavaScript engineer. Working on my FSJS Tech Degree at Treehouse. So this page will show my project portfolio as I go as well as any personal projects.
